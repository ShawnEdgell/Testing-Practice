# JavaScript Function Testing with Jest and Vite

This project demonstrates writing and testing several JavaScript functions using Jest. The project is set up with Vite to allow for ES6 modules.

## Functions
- **Capitalize:** A function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
- **Reverse String:** A function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
- **Calculator:** An object that contains functions for the basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
- **Caesar Cipher:** A function that performs a Caesar cipher on a given string based on a provided shift factor.
- **Analyze Array:** A function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object containing the average, min, max, and length of the array.

## Testing
Tests are written using Jest. Each function has its corresponding test file inside the /functions directory.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Development Server
This project uses Vite for local development. To start the Vite server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion
This project serves as a hands-on example of setting up Jest tests for JavaScript functions and running them alongside a Vite development environment.
